    <h2 style="text-align: center">Part 3: Text Analysis</h2><br></br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center">How has the overall perspective on Covid-19 changed over time?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">People’s attitude on Covid-19 changed over time. Our project analyzed text data from Twitter to see the changing trend in two time periods: 2020 quarter 3 and 2021 quarter 4. We used sentimental analysis and generated a word cloud to compare tweets related to Covid-19 during these two periods to see if it coincides with the fluctuating housing prices.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">From almost 100,000 tweets in 2020 quarter 3, nearly 47% of them are neutral, 29% are positive, and 24% are negative. Nearly 50,000 tweets in 2021 quarter 4 reveal that around 40% are neutral, 33% positive, and 27% negative. The decrease in neutral tweets and increase in both positive and negative tweets coincide with the pattern of increase in the Covid-19 rate and sales prices from quarter 3 in 2020 to the last quarter of 2021.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">The word clouds illustrate 100 most frequently appeared words in the tweets. Quarter 3 of 2020 highlights words like “new”,”covid-19”, “pandemic”, and “global”, reflecting the background of that time when the virus became a sudden global phenomenon. On the other hand, quarter 4 of 2021 has more words like “booster”, “growth”, and “vaccinated”, coinciding with daily problems that people are concerned about. The difference of word clouds over time reflects that people care less about covid-19 itself over time, but more about things including reaction of the government, vaccination, and booster. This phenomenon is consistent with the sales price fluctuation, in which it is less vulnerable to the virus as time passes by.</p>
