    <h3 style="text-align: center">Part 2: Geographical Variations</h3><br></br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">How has COVID-19 affected the NYC housing market?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class="list">Hypothesis 1: The association between COVID-19 and housing prices is negative.</li>
        <li class="list">Hypothesis 1: The association between COVID-19 and housing prices is positive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: center">Hypothesis 1 suggests that an increase in COVID-19 case rates is depreciating factor to property values. Hypothesis 2 suggests the opposite, namely that COVID-19 somehow raises the price of properties.  
      We will look at rolling sales data that provides information on average selling prices in NYC zipcode areas and observe 
      house prices in areas with the highest and the lowest COVID-19 case rates.</p>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center"> What are the main patterns?</h4>

    <p style="text-align: center"> These are the neighbourhoods that showed positive / negative association with fluctuations in COVID-19 case rates,
    from 2020 Q4 to 2022 Q1: </p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center"> Comparisons side-by-side</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center"> 2020 Q4 </p>
    <p style="text-align: center"> COVID-19 case rates were the highest in Breezy point -dubbed as "the summer oasis on the western tip of 
      Rockaway Peninsula"- foreshadowing the second wave of covid, marking the beginning of a new spread.
      The housing prices in Breezy point were relatively low, while the prices in Greenwich village
      -where COVID-19 rates were fairly low- were high. </p><br></br>
    <center><img src="Visualizations/Q42020_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align: center"> 2021 Q1 </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"> Acceleration in COVID-19 case rates was observed in Staten Island and the house prices here were low. Brighton
      beach in Brooklyn recorded the highest COVID-19 rates, and house prices were also relatively low. Notably, Greenwich village remained to be the
      neighbourhood with the highest price tag for housing, and COVID-19 case rates in this area was low.</p><br></br>
      <center><img src="Visualizations/Q12021_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
        <br></br>
      <p style="text-align: center"> 2021 Q2 </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"> This pattern in support of hypoyhesis 1 became extremely clear in the second quarter:
      1) COVID-19 was the most severe in Staten Island, where housing prices were the lowest.  2) House prices were also the highest in Lenox hill/ Upper
        East side, where COVID-19 case rates were the lowest.</p><br></br>
      <center><img src="Visualizations/Q22021_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
        <br></br>
        <p style="text-align: center"> 2021 Q3 </p>
        <p style="text-align: center"> Breezy Point in Brooklyn became a break out point for COVID-19 again and house prices were very low at this point. 
        On the other hand, the level of COVID-19 seemed moderate in expensive areas for housing (Hudson Yards in Manhattan and Edenwald in Bronx)</p><br></br>
        <center><img src="Visualizations/Q32021_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
          <br></br>
      <p style="text-align: center"> Turning point: 2021 Q4 </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"> In the last quarter of 2021, tables turned and the opposite pattern emerged: 1) Hudson yards,
      where average sales prices were the highest in the previous quarter still ranked first even with high COVID-19 rates. 2) 
      Areas where house prices were low displayed low COVID-19 case rates. This pattern gives alternative hypotheses a chance.</p><br></br>
      <center><img src="Visualizations/Q42021_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align: center"> Mixed patterns: 2022 Q1 </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"> The first three months of 2022 showed evidence for both hypotheses 1 & 2: 
      1) Hudson yards was both the spot for the worst COVID-19 case rates and the highest housing prices,   
      whilst 2) Tribeca contained very low COVID-19 and sold houses at high prices.</p><br></br>
      <center><img src="Visualizations/Q42021_tan.png" width="75%" class="center"></center>
      <br></br>
      <h4 style="text-align: center"> Final remarks? </h4>
      <p style="text-align: center"> In summary, housing prices in "Breezy point", "Greenwich village", "Lenox hill" and "Upper East Side" in 
      Manhattan; "Mott Haven" in  Bronx; "Brighton Beach" in Brooklyn and Staten Island were the geographical regions
    that showed the classic pattern of hitting low when COVID-19 cases were high and vice versa, which suggests that COVID-19 was general bad 
    for the housing market in these regions; While "Hudson Yards" and "Hell's kitchen" in manhattan, 
    and the entire Queens area tended to not follow this typical pattern and instead exhibited the opposite, suggesting that either COVID-19 had a positive 
    effect on house prices or that the value of housing followed an entirely different momentum that was unaffected by COVID-19 case rates.</p><br></br>
