    <h2 style="text-align: center">Part 1: Trends in Covid-19 and Sales Price</h2><br></br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center">How has Covid-19 affected the housing market via housing prices over time?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">We examined the Covid-19 rate and sales price in all five boroughs in NYC from the 3rd quarter of 2020 to the 1st quarter of 2022 to see if there are any notable patterns.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p style="text-align: center">The graph below illustrates the average sales prices and Covid-19 rates for all five boroughs on the same plot. Although it is difficult to pick up minute details from this graph, it is clear that both sales prices and Covid-19 rates surged towards the end of 2021 till the beginning of 2022.</p><br></br>

    <p style="text-align: center">The average sales prices and the Covid-19 rates will be further examined by focusing on each of the boroughs.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">1. Manhattan</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center"> The two variables follow a similar pattern in Manhattan, especially when both figures rise.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">Both the average sales price and Covid-19 rate increased during the last few months of 2020 simultaneously. Similar patterns can be observed at the end of 2021 to January 2022. However, a notable difference from the first peak in 2020 is that the sales price has increased before the Covid-19 rate. Overall, it can be seen that Manhattan’s sales price is highly vulnerable.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center">2. Bronx</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Patterns in Bronx are somewhat similar to that of Manhattan, but there seems to be a general pattern where the sales prices increase before the Covid-19 rates. The Covid-19 rate in January 2022 is unprecedentedly high, but compared to this, the increase in the sales price is not outstanding.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center">3. Brooklyn</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">The patterns found in Manhattan and the Bronx are all prevalent in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Similar to Manhattan, Brooklyn’s sales prices reached a peak in December 2021. The fluctuation in sales price is not as drastic compared to Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center">4. Queens</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Both the sales prices and Covid-19 rate in the Queens follow a similar pattern to that of Brooklyn, only with lower sales prices.</p>
    <br></br>
    <center><iframe src="queens.html" width="750" height="550"></iframe></center><br></br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">5. Staten Island</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Staten Island has higher rates of Covid-19 and lower sales prices compared to Brooklyn and Queens, but also reveals an identical pattern found in the other boroughs.</p>
