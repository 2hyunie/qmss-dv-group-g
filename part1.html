    <br></br><h3 style="text-align: center">Part 1: Trends in COVID-19 and Sales Price</h3><br></br>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">How has COVID-19 affected the housing market via housing prices over time?</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">We examined the COVID-19 rate and sales price in all five boroughs in NYC from the 3rd quarter of 2020 to the 1st quarter of 2022 to see if there are any notable patterns.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p style="text-align: center">The graph below illustrates the average sales prices and COVID-19 rates for all five boroughs on the same plot. Although it is difficult to pick up minute details from this graph, it is clear that both sales prices and COVID-19 rates surged towards the end of 2021 till the beginning of 2022.</p><br></br>
    <center><iframe src="all5.html" width="750" height="550"></iframe></center><br></br>
    <p style="text-align: center">The average sales prices and the COVID-19 rates will be further examined by focusing on each of the boroughs. The two plots that appear below have different scales for the sales prices and the COVID-19 rates and shows a horizontal line crossing the average value for each respective variable.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h5 style="text-align: center">1. Manhattan</h5>
    <p style="text-align: center"> The sales prices and COVID-19 rates follow a similar pattern in Manhattan, especially when both figures rise.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">Both the average sales price and COVID-19 rate increased during the last few months of 2020 simultaneously. Similar patterns can be observed at the end of 2021 to January 2022. However, a notable difference from the first peak in 2020 is that the sales price has increased before the COVID-19 rate. Overall, it can be seen that Manhattanâ€™s sales price is highly vulnerable.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align: center">2. Bronx</h5>
    <p style="text-align: center">Patterns in Bronx are somewhat similar to that of Manhattan, but there seems to be a general pattern where the sales prices increase before the COVID-19 rates. The COVID-19 rate in January 2022 is unprecedentedly high, but compared to this, the increase in the sales price is not outstanding.</p>
    <br></br>
    <center><img src="Visualizations/Bronx.png" width="750" height="auto"></center><br></br>
    <h5 style="text-align: center">3. Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island</h5>
    <p style="text-align: center">The patterns found in Manhattan and the Bronx are all prevalent in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. All five borough's sales prices reached a peak in December 2021. The fluctuation in the sales prices of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island is not as drastic compared to Manhattan and the Bronx.<br></br></p>
    <p style="text-align: center">This section reveals a parallel increase in COVID-19 rates and the sales prices in each borough. However, the line graphs do not show a clear pattern before the unprecedented increase. The relationship also differs in each borough so it is unclear to see the nature of the relationship that leads to the increase. It is also difficult to see why the sales prices plummet afterwards.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">Go to the next section to see this from a geographical perspective.</p>
